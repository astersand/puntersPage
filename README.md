# puntersPage

This is a basic solution for the assignment for the Punter's page assignment. It was created with Cypress version 14.5.1. It was not created following Page Object Model because it was a single page to test. 

To install all the files after copying repo you should run `npm init`. After everything is installed you can run the tests by running `npx cypress run` command in VS Code terminal or for better experience run `npx cypress open`, select E2E Testing type and select Chrome for browser. After that click Start E2E testing in Chrome and you will see a list of all the available tests to run. Select freeBets.cy.js and the test will start.
